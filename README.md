# M-CyPhySe
Intrusion Detection system for SAP CPS.


Update Logs of the code and the invariants:

Model-1 ( 25th March, 2019 )

1) Assuming that openAPS is up and running on the rig. We can use this script "invex.sh" to obtain the safety properties or the invariants which must hold for the system.

2) We can use these invariants in two ways, a) to attack the system and b) to detect intrusions

3) To get further information regarding the invariants, please check the branch M1 documentation.
